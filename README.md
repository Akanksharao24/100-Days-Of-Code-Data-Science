<h1 align="center">100 Days of Data Science Code</h1>


inspo - https://github.com/mankarsnehal/100-Days-of-Code-Data-Science/tree/main



## Motivation:
* Trying to get good at machine learning, bc it's the future and it's cool
* With this challenge, I'll give myself space to work on small/toy projects to start and will organically grow to work on bigger challenges

## Goal
* Get hands-on practice with exploratory data analysis, training, and evaluation
* Apply the things I've learned in AI, ML, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and AI System Design




Starting a 100 Days Code Challenge for Learning Data Science from Scratch is my goal for Learning Data Science in Machine Learning:

  - Learning Fundamentals of Python
  - Python Libraries for Data Science
  - Data Manipulation and Preprocessing
  - Machine Learning Basics
  - Advanced Machine Learning Techniques
  - Deep Learning and Neural Networks
  - Model Evaluation and Deployment
  - Data Science Project and Wrap-Up
