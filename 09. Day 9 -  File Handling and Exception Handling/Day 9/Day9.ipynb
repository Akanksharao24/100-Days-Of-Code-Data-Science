        "\n",
        "1. **Opening a File:**\n",
        "   - `open()`: To open a file, specifying the file name and mode (read, write, append, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Modes of File Opening:**\n",
        "   - `r`: Read\n",
        "   - `w`: Write (creates a new file or truncates an existing file)\n",
        "   - `a`: Append (opens a file for appending data)\n",
        "   - `b`: Binary mode\n",
        "   - `+`: Read and Write mode\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Reading from a File:**\n",
        "   - `read()`: Reads the entire file.\n",
        "   - `readline()`: Reads a single line from the file.\n",
        "   - `readlines()`: Reads all lines in the file and returns a list.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Writing to a File:**\n",
        "   - `write()`: Writes a string to the file.\n",
        "   - `writelines()`: Writes a list of lines to the file.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Closing a File:**\n",
        "   - `close()`: Closes the file, releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Context Managers (`with` statement):**\n",
        "   - Ensures proper acquisition and release of resources (automatically closes the file).\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Working with File Paths:**\n",
        "   - `os.path.join()`: Joining paths.\n",
        "   - `os.path.exists()`: Checking if a file exists.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Exception Handling:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Try-Except Blocks:**\n",
        "   - `try`: Contains the code that might raise an exception.\n",
        "   - `except`: Contains the code to be executed if an exception is raised.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Handling Specific Exceptions:**\n",
        "   - `except ExceptionType as e`: Handles a specific type of exception.\n",
        "   - Common exceptions include `FileNotFoundError`, `TypeError`, `ValueError`, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Multiple Except Blocks:**\n",
        "   - Handling multiple exceptions with different `except` blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Else Block:**\n",
        "   - `else`: Code to be executed if no exceptions are raised.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Finally Block:**\n",
        "   - `finally`: Code that is always executed, whether an exception is raised or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Raising Exceptions:**\n",
        "   - `raise`: Manually raise an exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Custom Exceptions:**\n",
        "   - Defining and using custom exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Exception Hierarchy:**\n",
        "   - Understanding the hierarchy of exceptions (e.g., `BaseException`, `Exception`, specific exception classes).\n",
